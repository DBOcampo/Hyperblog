From time to time I like to walk in a vile of puke because I am the cute cure
But not the purest,  I am the hardest to ever live try me and you'll get decieved
This is not a joke I dont get anxious and do coke I hide in my mansion
With a couple hoes, while im watching tv driking 4's, yeah I dont care about
your opinion, I am a junior with the level of a senior, run up on me and
and you will end up in your, cave, crying and trying to ask for help, I didnt
know how much pain I could held, I'm in a death race for my sanity, wonder if this
world is real or just an insanity, could I really fly without gravity? Well that
depends on if this is really reality, or a reality show, bitches get stunned when
they get to glow, they get brazy when they hear this flow, if one of them gets moody
they go down below, not with the devil but with the worms, 7 feet in the ground you can
mark my words, I'm really not evil, I'm just the real deal, I came here to serve you a 
meal, but its not food, theyre bullets and theyre directly from the hood, leave your face
on the ground looking not good
